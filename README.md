# Australia-COVID19-dashboard
This is the project for UTS 48001 Project BEngSc.
Our product is a web-based application tracking the spread of recent outbreak coronavirus (COVID-19) in Australia. The dashboard is composed of four main modules which are card module, map module, chart module and table module. The card module would show the summary information about how many confirmed, death and recovery cases in Australia. Also, there is a table that contains the daily update information about coronavirus for each state. The primary function of this dashboard is an interactive map that visualizes the spread of the COCID-19 in Australia. Besides that, there are some figures in the chart module, such as the line plot about the case timeline and the pie chart of Australian states infection rate.

WBS of our project is shown as follows.
